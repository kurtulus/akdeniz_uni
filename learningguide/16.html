Most Americans if you ask them in you take a survey will say that they believe in some sort of god, in terms of religions very high percentage of Americans identify themselves say someone ask them. If they believe in god in what religion will give a specific religion, then I would say I think the most current information is about 75% of Americans call themselves Christian, and about maybe 13-14% call themselves say they are not religious at all, and then the rest of the percentage are very small for different religions Judaism those who are Jewish is about 1,3% is what I have read and other religions are even smaller than that in terms of percentage of people in the United States who say they are in that religion. Now the 75% of those who are religious about 25% of the total population of the United States calls themselves Catholic and these are Christian who believe in, we would also called Roman Catholic Church with the Pope in the Vatican in Italy that is the single largest Christian Church in the United States. Still a minority however that is still not the majority of people, but the largest group in terms of Christian groups, other 50 sum % of the population that is Christian are what we would call Protestants. Word protestant comes from the word to protest. To protest is when you don’t like something and you want it to be changed and these are Churches that beginning with in the, I believed the 16</span><span class="T11">th</span><span class="T2"> century in the 1500s. These churches that began in protest to problems in the Catholic Church at that time and so these are called English Protestant, we were adding –and to protest and becomes protestant. These are Protestant Churches and there are many dozens, may be hundreds of different Churches in this category. In the United States the largest church is probably, protestant church is probably the Baptist Church which is particularly popular in the southern part of the US. When we say in the south, we are talking about the United States; we are talking about Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, probably Kentucky </span><span class="T2">Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Those are the states, south eastern part of the United States, which also happens to be probably more religious than say people who live in Los Angeles or in New York. So over all the Americans are consider themselves very religious of course just because you say you are religious doesn’t mean you necessarily are doing the right thing. That is another issue.  </span></p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
