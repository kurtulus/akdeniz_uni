We are also going to talk about town Pueblo which is an historic town in New Mexico in the southwest part of the United States and we will always answer a few of your questions. Let’s get started. </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">We begin this café with a discussion of a famous American author Betty Friedan. Betty Friedan is most famous for her writings about and participation in the woman’s rights movement. The word movement here means organized effort or an organized attempt to accomplish some political goal. Woman’s rights would refer to the right of woman; think that may be specific to the rights of woman. The woman’s rights movement was popular in 1960s and 70s, in particular that is the time when Betty Friedan first became famous as someone who was a leader of that movement. Friedan was what we would call in advocate as well as an author. An advocate means that she worked hard to protect the rights of other people. She of course was also a woman, but when we talk about someone being an advocate, we are talking about them trying to protect the rights of other people. We sometimes call a lawyer or an attorney, an advocate, someone who argues for you in front of a judge, Betty Friedan was born on February 4</span><span class="T9">th</span><span class="T2"> 1921 when she was growing up in 1920s and 30s, she experienced the traditional roles for girls and young women especially when it came to children, taking care of the children was something that women were always expected to do. There were some women, who went to college, had jobs during the early part of the 20</span><span class="T9">th</span><span class="T2"> century in the United States. Many of them however when they got married, quitted their jobs to raise their families, to be at home and take care of their children. Betty Friedan didn’t want her life to be like that, </span><span class="T2">she decided to go to college, to a woman’s college by the name of Smith. After she graduated from Smith College, she got a job working at a magazine in New York. In 1947 she also married, she married a man by the name of Carl Friedan. They had a son in 1948, but Betty went back to work two years after her son was born. When she got pregnant with her second child in 1952, she was fired from her job; she was told she had to leave her job. So Betty stayed at home with her children and took care of them as most American mothers did at this time. In 1956 Betty and Carl had their third child. Betty was not happy being at home all the time with her children. It was what society, what people living in the United States expected of woman, but she was not happy with it. She felt there was something missing in her life. She decided to go and interview some of her friends who were also mother to see off they were happy. Now it is very important understand that Betty Friedan’s group of interviewees, the women that she spoke with were all or most all of them part of her own social circle. She was college educated woman in 1940s that was a very common thing at least not as common as it is today. So the women with whom she spoke were certainly not typical of American women during this time. That is the point that some people sometimes forget when they look at her work, at her book. The book that made her famous was a collection of these interviews and her analysis of them called the Feminine Mystique. Feminine refers to female, to woman. Mystique refers to a set of beliefs about person or kind of person. The word mystique is often related to something that is secret or mysterious about this person. The title of the book refers to or talks about the ideas that many people had about woman especially in 1950s and early 1960s. It talked about their beliefs about what a woman should do as she got older, their beliefs about marriage and about the role or the job or the function of woman within a marriage. In the book, Friedan talked about what her friends from college had said when she interviewed them, she talked about how woman, the woman she interviewed, wanted more from life than to be happy home makers. A home maker is a person who stays at home, cooks, cleans and takes care of the children in the family. Friedan talked about how many of her friends loved their children but also wanted to work outside the home. Friedan said that society was making woman do something that they did not want it to do which was to stay at home. As you can imagine the book was very shocking, very surprising to many people. Many people got angry at the message of the book, said that Friedan was wrong about what American woman wanted from their lives. The book became popular and made Friedan a national figure a very well-known author and speaker. The term the Feminine Mystique later became synonymous with or the same as or having the same meaning as the woman’s rights movement, so there is a connection between this title, the Feminine Mystique and the </span><span class="T2">popularity of the woman’s right movement especially during the 1960s and 1970s. Friedan was of course happy that her book sold a lot of copies, all authors are happy when their books sell a lot of copies, but she wanted to do more, she wanted woman to become more involved in politics, so she started an organization or helped start an organization called the National Organization for Woman or NOW. This organization is still around and some people think it is still important in the cause of woman’s rights. When Friedan grew up woman did not have the kinds of opportunity and choices that they do now, some people say that Betty Friedan’s book and the movement that she found it are the cause of the changes in the American economy, in American society, in general other people would point to or indicate other reasons why woman’s participation in the work force, in the job market as we might call it has increased over the years that are unrelated to the political developments, but we are not here, answer that question rather the talk about why Betty Friedan is famous and continues to be a hero.          </span></p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
