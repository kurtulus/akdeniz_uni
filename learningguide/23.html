Dorothy Parker was an American author, an American writer, born in 1893 in the state of New Jersey which is located next to the state of New York and the east coast of the United States. Dorothy Parker is best known for her short stories and poems, but she also wrote plays, screen plays which are scripts for movies as well as many, many book reviews. In her writings and her real lives she was known to say funny things people would describe her as witty. If you are witty, you say things that are very funny in a clever way, in an intelligent way often very quickly after someone else has said something. To be witty means to be quick in giving a funny comment. Dorothy Parker was certainly someone who was considered witty in her day. Her first jobs were in New York City at some very important magazines, New York was then as it is now really the capital of publishing in the United States both book and magazine publishing. The biggest book publishers and magazine publishers have offices in New York City and that where Dorothy Parker went in her early 20s. She worked at some of the famous magazines in the United States of the time. She worked at Vogue Magazines which is fashion magazines at least it is now. She worked at Vanity Fair Magazine and most importantly she worked at the New Yorker Magazine. The New Yorker is considered the best literary magazine, the best magazine in terms of good quality writing that was through 1920s, it is still through today and each of these magazines Parker wrote reviews. A review is basically your opinion in writing about books, plays, movies, songs, or any other sort of artistic production; it could be a review of art show for example. In addition to her reviews she also published some of her own poems and stories. We say something is published we means it is printed in magazine or book for people to buy and read. Well, in New York Dorothy met a man by the name of Edwin Pond Parker whom she married in 1917 thus taking the name Dorothy Parker. Her maiden name, the name that she was born with was Rothschild. Their marriage lasted only about 10 years, they were divorced in 1928. Parker met another man Alan Campbell. She married Campbell in 1934 and remained married to him until his death in 1963. Dorothy Parker was a very prolific writer; someone who is prolific is someone who writes a lot in this case a lot of poems and stories. </span><span class="T2">She published her first set of poems in 1926 and it became best seller. When something is best seller, it sells a lot of books more than other books that are being sold. She wrote two more poetry collections after that first best selling collection. Parker is also known for writing very interesting short stories. She would write short stories in often published in magazines like The New Yorker later she would publish compilations. A compilation is a collection of something, usually a collection of poems or stories or possibly even songs. You take those songs or poems or plays or stories that have been published in other places and you put them altogether and you sell them in one book or as one group. This is what Parker did some of her stories and it was a very successful compilation. Parker was considered as I mentioned earlier very witty woman. She was in fact friends with some of the greatest writers and comedies or people whose job it is to tell jokes of the 1920s, these included George Kaufman, Edna Ferber, Harold Ross and Harper Marks, one of the famous Marks brothers. She was also a member of famous literary group called the Algonquin Round Table. A Round Table is usually a group of people may be 8, 10, 15 people who get together and talk about some common interest they have. This really was a lunch group; they got together almost every day for period of about 10 years at a hotel called Algonquin. It is a hotel in New York City. Parker and her friends talked about poems, they would talk about plays, and they would talk about stories that had been published. They would also of course tell jokes and funny stories. Many people believe this round table, this group of writers was one of the most interesting and influential groups of writers in American literary history. In 1934 Parker having married Alan Campbell moved here to Los Angeles to Hollywood, here she became along with her husband a screen writer. A screen writer stories for movies nowadays also for television shows. Together Campbell and Parker wrote a couple of popular screen plays or screen play for a couple popular movies, the most famous of those was A Star is Born in 1937. This was considered one of the best screen plays of that year. It was nominated or selected as a possible winner for several academy awards or Oscar. Parker and Campbell were successful in here in Hollywood they did, have some problems when it came to their politics. After World War II, in the late 1940s and 1950s there was great concern about the influence of Communism in the United States. Communism was the political system of the Soviet Union and later Communist China. This lead a lot of people to fear Communism since especially the Soviet Union was considered our enemy at the time. One of the results of change in the political environment in the United States was that certain writers, certain directors, certain actors who were suspected of being communist were black-listed. If you are black-listed, you are told that you can’t work at any of the place in your own profession. To be black-listed means to be prevented from being hired to work. In the case of Hollywood, to be black-listed meant not to be given any jobs, any work from the big major movie studios here in Los Angeles. Black-listing affected a lot of different groups, it continues today in some places, it is not an official list of the government publishes, however in the 1940s and 50s government at least some member of the government did name people who they thought should not get a job or Hollywood or in other industries, in other types of work. The reason Hollywood was so important was of course that this was the and still is the major from of social communication, movies and later television shows. The idea was that you didn’t want people who had bad political ideas or dangerous political ideas working and influencing people through their stories and through their productions. Now some of the people who were black-listed in the late 40s and 1950s were in </span><span class="T2">fact communist. They said they were communist and Parker is an example of that she proclaimed or said aloud very publicly that she was a communist. It is not surprising and then black-listed. Many people believe that there was an over-reaction to the influence of communist in the United States during the 40s and 50s. An over-reaction is when do too much because you think the situation is more serious than it really is. That is not to say that they were not in fact communist in the United States who were working against the US government, some of them were actually arrested for spying for the Soviet Union. Parker was not a spy however, and she didn’t probably do any damage to the American political system, but she was black-listed and this meant that she and her husband had to leave Los Angeles and return to New York City. Despite Parker’s success in her career, she was considered her own harshest critic. Harsh is tough or difficult to say that she was her own harshest critic means that she was the one who is most critical of her own writing who would criticize and find problems with of her own writing. Parker died of a heart attack about 4 years after the death of her husband in 1963 and she died in 1967 at the age of 73. Interestingly……. (13:04) she left her a state that is money and property to the reverent and doctor Martin Luther King junior. She left the money to King’s organization because she was a strong supporter of civil rights of the quality for people of different races. I have never actually read any of Dorothy Parker’s stories; I am familiar with one funny line that she wrote. It is probably her most famous line. “Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses” at girls who wear glasses. To make pass means to try to get a woman romantically interesting in you. I was never very good at that, but some men are very good at getting women to be interesting in them. What Parker’s saying here is that men seldom that are not very often make passes at girls who wear glasses. The idea being of course that if you are wearing glasses you are not as attractive or pretty as other girls or it could also mean that men don’t want to date or go out with women who are considered intelligent or smart, at least not smarter than they are. </span></p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
