We are also going to talk about a popular racing event especially among children called soup box derby. And as always we will answer a few of your questions. Let’s get start it. </span></p><p class="Standard"><span class="T2">William Faulkner was an American author best known for his novels about the American south or what is sometimes simply called in the US the south. The south is actually the south eastern part of the United States, so if you look at a map of the United States, if you look at the south east corner where Florida is and the states around there that 25% of country is called the south. Arizona and New Mexico are in the southern part of the US, but no one considers that the south. The south is always the south eastern part of the US. Sometimes it is called the Deep South, but in any case Americans know when you refer to the south what you are talking about, the south in many ways was defined by the central event in American history, certainly in the 19</span><span class="T11">th</span><span class="T2"> century and that would be the American civil war, the south wanted to keep slavery legal in the United States and the north wanted to get rid of it, to abolished it. The south lost the war and even today more than 150 years since the civil war began, there is still an association in the minds of Americans with the south and the civil war. Those two things are often connected in the American imagination, at least for those who don’t live in </span><span class="T2">the south. William Faulkner did live in the south; he was born on September 25 1897 in a small town in the State of Mississippi. Mississippi is located in the south eastern US, in the south as we call it. He was born in a small town that was about 130 km,</span><span class="T1"> </span><span class="T2">south east of Memphis Tennessee which is a larger city. This small town and small towns that Faulkner lived in became the inspirations or the things that gave Faulkner ideas for writing his novels and his novels are most famously about the American south, especially the American south during the first half of the 20</span><span class="T11">th</span><span class="T2"> century. Faulkner was interested in writing from early age when he was very young, his mother and grandmother told him how to paint and draw. By the time he was 12, he was already writing poetry. Although he loved reading and writing, he did not love school. He found school boring and eventually dropped out. To drop out is a phrasal verb meaning to stop going to school. We talk about people dropping out of high school; we are talking about young kids, boys and girls, who don’t finish their high school degree and the US nowadays it is require that you go to school until the age of 16 in most states, but it isn’t require that you graduate from high school although most people do. Faulkner did not graduate from high school instead he continued to write on his own. He fell in love with a girl and was very disappointed when the girl decided to marry another man. Faulkner was so disappointed by this that he eventually moved out of Mississippi with a friend of the family and moved to Connecticut. Connecticut is a state in the north eastern part of the United States, very far from Mississippi. There Faulkner stated to write more poetry and eventually when World War I broke out; when World War I started Faulkner decided that he wanted to join the effort. However the United States military rejected Faulkner, they said ‘no you can’t be a soldier, because you are too short,’ he was only 5 feet 6 inches which is about 1, 7 meters tall. So instead Faulkner went to Canada and he tried to join the British royal air force by training in Canada. One of the things Faulkner did to get accepted by the British royal air force was change the spelling of his last name. We spell his last name Faulkner, but the original spelling did not have the “u” in it. Faulkner thought that putting the “u” in it would make it sound more British and so he changed his name. However the war ended before Faulkner was ever sent to Europe; he instead returned to his home state of Mississippi and went to the University of Mississippi. He once again was bored by school, he wasn’t very good student, he stayed only 3 semesters at the university. A semester at an American university is usually around 15 weeks, there is typically two main semesters one in the fall and one in the spring although many colleges and universities have summer semesters which are often shorter in terms of the number of weeks. In any case Faulkner dropped out this time of college, because he was bored, he worked in a couple of different jobs he even moved to New York City briefly. Finally in 1924 he published his first book of poetry, it was called The Marble Faun and it was not very successful, but it sold about a thousand copies, about a thousand books were sold. Then the following year in 1925 he published his first novel, this was called Soldier’s Pay. A soldier is someone who fights in an army or in the military. After the book was published, Faulkner did what a lot of young readers were doing in the early part of the 20</span><span class="T11">th</span><span class="T2"> century, he went to Paris, and he went to France and lived outside of the Paris continuing his writing. However one of Faulkner’s friends, another famous author told Faulkner he should come back to the United States and write about what he knew, he should write about Mississippi, he should write about the American south. That writer’s name is Sherwood Anderson who as I said was also a famous writer during his own life time. Over the next 30 years, Faulkner took </span><span class="T2">Anderson’s advice and wrote about the south. In particular he wrote about social issues that were important at that time including racism, the discrimination against someone because of the color of their skin. He also wrote about what we might call southern aristocracy. Aristocracy refers usually to very wealthy people. Southern aristocracy would be the wealthy families in the south, almost all of which were of course white families. Faulkner in some of his books created a fictional county a place wasn’t real, but was based on or was taken from his experiences in the towns that he did living in Mississippi. Many readers and critics said that Faulkner’s books did a wonderful job of really capturing or conveying or communicating the language of the way people talk in the south, in the small communities during this time period. Faulkner’s first famous book was called ‘The Sound and The Fury’, which was published in 1929. This was one of the first very successful novels that Faulkner wrote. I said it was published in 1929, Faulkner also married in 1929. Who did he marry? He married the same girl who he was in love with more than ten years earlier, who married another man. That woman divorced her first husband and married Faulkner who had always loved her. Faulkner continued to publish novels including Sanctuary, The Story of Temple Drake, Absalom, Absalom! And in the late 1940s Intruder in the Dust. Many of the themes or topics that these novels treated or discussed were rather controversial. When we say something is controversial we mean that many people disagreed about them people will + Nevertheless Faulkner became a successful novelist; he also wrote for the movies, he wrote scripts for movies, he didn’t really want to, he didn’t like writing for the movies, but he wanted money and so he wrote what are called screen plays which are basically the scripts of movies. Although Faulkner wrote about the south and it is in many ways, conservative ways his writing was very modern, his style of writing was considered very modern. He used in some of his novels what is called stream of consciousness, a technique that involves a single character in the book talking for very long time what is the essentially a monologue or one person is talking. Stream of consciousness writing often includes very long sentences; it is almost as though the person isn’t planning in advance what they are going to say, there is simply saying what is occurring to them at that moment, at least that is the impression people how when they read novels that are written in this style. Faulkner used this technique in some of his own books. In the late 1940s there were a couple of collections of Faulkner’s stories that were published. These collections made Faulkner’s writing more well-known, especially in Europe. He was awarded 1949 Nobel Prize in literature one of the most prestigious and highly sought-after prizes one might say in the world of literature of writing. After he won the Nobel, he continued to win other awards for his writings. He continued to write in the 1950s but he also had some difficulties in his personal life. He had a daughter born in 1933 who lived to be an adult, but Faulkner wasn’t exactly the greatest father on the world, he drank too much, he had romantic relationships outside of his marriage and probably would not win any awards for his family life. However he continued to write and in 1962 in July he died of a heart attack.          </span></p></body></html>
