It is an entertainment show called American Idol. Idol here means someone that you admire, someone that you like usually a famous performer, a singer or an actor; it could also be a politician. You say he is my idol means he is someone who I look up to, is another expression, to look up to someone means to respect them, to think highly of their ideas and opinions. Well, American Idol is a singing contest, a singing competition. Contest and competition are really very similar in meaning. It is a competition where people have to come on the program and sing and the program tries to find the best singer and usually what they are trying to do is to find the best undiscovered singer. Undiscovered means that they are not famous, nobody knows about them, but they are very good singers and they are mostly high school students and people in college. I think the age is 16 and 28, and this show which is very popular always number one every week in The United States when it is on is what we would call as spin-off a British television program. A spin-off is when you have one television show and you create a second television show that is related to it. Well, American Idol is a spin-off away program from Great Britain in England called Pop Idol. Pop as in popular music. Pop Idol and so American Idol is related to that. That verb, spin off, can be used for things other than television, a company for example, a big company may have many different divisions, many different parts and they decide to sell one of their parts. They could spin it off into a separate company so that would become separate from them. Well, </span><span class="T2">each season of American Idol, season when we talk about television show just means usually 4 or 6 or 8 months that the program is on. This season for American Idol is usually from January to May. So it lasts let’s see 1, 2,3,4,5 months and each week there are two shows. The show begins in January with people going to what are called auditions. An audition is when you are a singer or an actor and you want to be a part of a group or play or movie, you have to go and show the casting director who is the person who decides a cast, refers to the people in a play or movie or television show, so casting director is the person that decides who is going to be picked, who is going to be selected or chosen. In American Idol, there are 3 judges, 3 people who decide we would call them panel of judges. A panel is a group of people usually who are either deciding something or they could be at a conference or a convention or a panel are a group of people who talk about the same topic. A panel of judges, a group of judges people who make decisions in this case they make decisions about which of the contestant is going to go on to the next round. A contestant is a person in the contest, a person who participating in the competition. I said that they decide who is going to move on to the next round and each level or each part of the competition is called round. So the first several weeks of the program, you have people from all around the country and they start off with I don’t know five, six thousand people and eventually they pick a smaller group and then smaller group and then smaller group until you have end up with or you have at the end I think 12 people who are competing and at that point the people who are watching the show can vote for the person that they want to go to the next round and so after the program is over they have a set of telephone numbers what we would call toll-free numbers. Toll-free, toll is like a fee or a tax and toll-free means that you don’t have to pay any money even though it is a long-distance call. So you call up and you vote for the person that you like the best and I think they give you a couple of hours after the show. So that is on Tuesday night and then on Wednesday night everyone comes back to see who got the list number of votes. And there is the person who has to leave. Of course they do that until you have one winner. Well, as I say it is very popular show and one of the reasons I think it is popular is that one of the 3 judges. His name is Simon Cowell. He is actually British, has a British accent and he is famous on the show for in the worst of one person being harsh and blunt in his rejections. To be harsh is sort of the same as to be mean, to be not very nice, to criticize someone to say bad things about someone that is to be harsh. To be blunt means that you tell people what you think even if you think they are going to be hurt by it. So to blunt means to tell the truth but to tell the truth to someone who may not like it or maybe hurt by hearing that. Cowell is harsh and blunt on his rejections of course to reject means to say naughty something, so he has to decide who is going from one round to the next round and often these are very harsh criticism, but some people seem to like that and sometimes they are very funny and that is one of the reasons why the show is very popular. Several people who have won on the program have become famous singers in the United States. The first winner was a woman by the name of Kelly Clarkson. I think that was the first season that they have the competition, the first contest about 5 years ago. So most Americans know who Simon Cowell is, they knew about American Idol and I know that in many countries now there are similar programs like this. There are programs in many different countries, so you may be already familiar with that in your own country.    </span></p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
