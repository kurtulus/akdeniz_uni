The silence of the lambs was first released or first shown in movie theatre on February 14</span><span class="T8">th</span><span class="T2"> in 1999. The film became an instant or immediate success with both audience people watching the movie and critics people who write about movies and give their opinions about movies. The movie was based on a book by Thomas Harris which is also called the silence of the lambs. A lamb is an animal that we usually associate with the material wool made from the hair of a lamb. A lamb is also something that used to be sacrificed in many ancient religions, they would sacrificed an animal, a lamb is one of those animals that you will find for example in the old testament of the Bible where the Jewish people want it to offer or sacrifice to god, they would often use a lamb and by sacrifice I mean kill the lamb, so there is a symbolism to the word lamb, the idea of the lamb in it is that symbolism which is probably more closely related to this novel which is about someone who murders woman. Two well-known actors played in the movie version of the silence of the lamb. One of them was the British actor Antony Hopkins; he played the evil doctor Hannibal Lecter. The other famous actor was Jodie Foster. She played Clarice Starling an FBI agent who was in training. The FBI stands for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It is part of the national government that is sort of act like a police force for the United States. Clarice is in training meaning she is learning how to do something in this case she is going to school to become an FBI agent or officer. In the film, there is a serial killer by the name of Buffalo Bill. A serial killer is a person who murders many different people often in the some way over a certain period of time, sometimes years. Usually the victims the people who are murdered have something in common with each other. They might all be women or on some cases they might be children or young boys. The most common victims I will guess of serial killers would be women. The FBI is trying to find Buffalo Bill; they try to find him by using the technique called profiling. To profile someone is to find out what his personality is like. To try to understand a person, the kind of person who would commit this sort of crime. Profiling is a way of thinking about the kind of person and then trying to find someone who fits that description. Profiling is somewhat controversial nowadays, because people associate the world with identifying potential terrorist in the United States and the risks that involves in term of civil liberties and freedom. However, from the police perspective </span><span class="T2">thinking of it as a police officer for example profiling is an important tool to try to understand the criminal, understand the person who they are trying to catch. The FBI agents are interviewing other serial killers in the movie in order to figure out who are the serial killers might be, to understand his personality I should mention that Buffalo Bill was a famous person in the 19</span><span class="T8">th</span><span class="T2"> century, that has nothing to do with serial killing. We will talk about him and some other episode. Here it is just the name given to the serial killer. Jack Crawford played by Scott Glenn in the movie is the head or leader of the FBI’s behavioral science unit. This is the part of FBI that in charge of profiling and understanding people who are killers or who are criminals. Jack asks Chris to help his team by interviewing the most notorious or famously bad serial killer of all the time in the movie, Doctor Hannibal Lecter. Hannibal Lecter is a former psychiatrist. A psychiatrist is a doctor who listens to people and tries to help them, tries to help with mental and emotional problems. Hannibal Lecter is very smart and therefore very dangerous. Clarice goes to visit Hannibal in the Baltimore state hospital for the criminally insane. Baltimore is a city located in the eastern part of the United States, in the state of Maryland. It is a hospital for the criminally insane. Criminally means you have broken the law, you are criminal, you have something wrong. Insane means that you are sick not in your body but in your mind in your brain. To be insane is the opposite of to be sane which means to be thinking correctly, to be mentally healthy I guess we might say. Hannibal promises to help Clarice and the FBI find Buffalo Bill if Clarice will talk to him about her traumatic or emotionally difficult childhood. Clarice had a difficult childhood when she was growing up. She agrees to talk to Hannibal about her own past. Over the rest of the movie, Clarice and Hannibal meet several times, each time Clarice learns about more about the serial killers Buffalo Bill, and Hannibal learns about Clarice, so the two develop a relationship not just as a criminal and FBI agent, but as a therapist and a patient. A therapist is another word in this case for psychiatrist or someone who talks to you to help you to your mental and emotional problems. During the film Clarice and those of us watching the movie, the audiences come to understand just how dangerous Hannibal Lecter is. He manipulates or controls the minds of everyone around him. Usually without those around him knowing that he is in control of the situation. His ability to manipulate leads to very surprise ending which I of course won’t tell you if you haven’t seen the movie, you will want to be surprised yourself. The silence of the lambs was not only very popular movie, it also won five Oscar award in 1992.</span></p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
