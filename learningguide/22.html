A musical is a story where actors sing and dance as well as talk. Musicals are mostly often associated with The New York Theatre district, particularly the street of Broadway. When people talk about Broadway musical, they are referring to one of these singing plays we could call them, there is being performed or has been performed in one of the big theatres in New York City. A Broadway musical is not just performed on Broadway however you can see musicals in almost any city, any sides in the United States in fact one of the most popular traditions in high school in secondary schools in the US is for the students to perform a musical every year. That was certainly case in my high school. I of course because I am such a good singer after I try to be in my high school musical, they made me work on the lightening crew. I was responsible for turning the lights on and off. I never did get on the actual stage to sing. I wonder why. Anyway Hello Dolly was a musical that was extremely popular in 1960s. It was based on a play by one of the best 20</span><span class="T8">th</span><span class="T2"> century American playwrights, a person who writes plays, named Thornton Wilder. Wilder wrote a play called matchmaker. A matchmaker is a person who helps find a romantic partner for someone, so they can get married. A matchmaker is someone who knows perhaps a beautiful woman and handsome man and matchmaker tries to get them together. In many cultures matchmakers are people who are well-respected in the community that people will go to find a husband or a wife. Nowadays we just go to Facebook I guess I don’t know. Well, in the old days people went to a matchmaker and that is what the Thornton Wilder’s play was about. In the play the Matchmaker, there is a rich man by the name of Horace. Horace wants to marry a certain woman and so in order to help the process of getting this woman interested in him; he goes to the woman’s best friend. The woman’s best friend is someone named Dolly. Dolly is also interested in Horace, so Horace is going to Dolly so that Dolly can connect him up with this other woman. But Dolly wants to marry Horace herself. So as you can imagine there are a lot of funny things that happen because of this situation. The musical Hello Dolly was based on Thornton Wilder’s play the Matchmaker. In the musical, the story takes place in a town in the state of New York. Just north of the New York City a place called Yonkers. Well, the plays turned into a musical in the early 1960s. It made its appearance on Broadway in 1964. Like many famous musicals it was a collaborative effort in this case between two people. When we say something is collaborative we mean that two or more people work together in order to produce it. The two people who wrote Hello Dolly were Jerry Herman and Michael Steward. </span><span class="T2">Jerry Herman was the composer. A composer is the person who writes the music. Herman was also the lyricist. A lyricist is a person who writes the words or the lyrics the song in the musical. Herman’s partner Michael Steward was the librettist, is basically the person who writes and puts together the entire play including the story and words that are spoken instead of song by the performers or actors. The musical as I said debuted or was first performed on Broadway in January of 1964. The woman who played Dolly was a famous actress Carol Channing and Horace was played by another actor by David Burns. There are some other members of the cast that is people who is performers in the musicals who are also famous or later became famous including Charles Nelson Reilly and Eileen Brennan. The musical was a huge success both the critics the people whose job it is to give opinions about performances as well as the audience people who pay money to watch the play, the musicals loved Hello Dolly. The award given for the best musicals and plays in the United States called the Tony Award. Well, Hello Dolly was nominated for eleven Tony Awards in 1964. The Tony Awards are sort of like the academy awards for movies. Hello Dolly won ten of the eleven awards that were nominated for including best musical, best actress in the musical and best costume or clothing worn in the play. Hello Dolly reigned or continued to be performed on Broadway almost seven years, so it made a lot of money. It closed or ended on December 27</span><span class="T8">th</span><span class="T2"> 1970 after more than 2800 performances. The show was reviewed or brought back to the stage three more times. First in 1975, then in 1978 and again in 1995. Most Americans haven’t seen the musical at least in a lived theatre, but they have seen the movie Hello Dolly which was based on the musical. The movie Hello Dolly came out in 1969, one of the best songs in the musical is called Hello Dolly. It is song at the beginning of act too or the second part of the musical. The characters in the play have all returned the New York City and are having dinner at a very expensive restaurant. The song is performed by Dolly herself as well as the waiters in the restaurant. Of course in musicals things happen that would never really happen in real life, but this is a play or in this case a movie and so almost anything can happen. In the song Dolly tells all the waiter how wonderful they are and the waiters in return tell Dolly how wonderful she looks and how happy they   are to see her again after being away for a long time. The refrain or the part of the song that song over and over again goes like this: Hello Dolly well Hello. Dolly it is so nice to have back where you belong.    </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
