Crowdsourcing (all one word) is a relatively new practice of getting a large group of people usually by contacting them on the Internet to do one of several possible things. You could use crowdsourcing to get new ideas or new information from people. You could use crowdsourcing to solve some problem that requires a lot of different people. You could also use crowdsourcing to ask people for money that you need in order to run a certain project or even start a new business that is the use of crowdsourcing we are going to talk about today people who use crowdsourcing to get money for their businesses. We are going to start by listening to a woman named Ya Ell Crigman. Ya Ell and enjoys making desserts, sweet things that you eat after a meal. And she wants to open a shop that is a store where she can sell things that she makes. We will listen first that she talks about how she began to consider crowdsourcing as a possibility for helping her start her business, try to understand as much as you can and then we will go back and explain what she said. Let’s listen. </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">I was talking to a friend of mine and we were discussing the different options for financing my storefront and we talked about bank loan, investors and he told me Kickstarter. Ya Ell says that she was speaking with a friend about different options for financing her storefront. She says I was talking to a friend of mine and we were discussing the different options for financing my store front. Notice she says a friend of mine that means the same as my friend. Options are possibilities or choices that you can make in order to do what you need to do. Financing comes from the verb to finance which means to find or we might use the verb raise money in order to pay for something. People talk about financing the purchase of a new car. You need to buy a new car but you don’t have all the money so you need to finance it which in that case means you usually get a loan from someone. Someone gives you money that you have to give them back plus a certain fee what we would call interest, but there are other ways of financing of getting money for something especially if you are starting a new business. </span><span class="T2">Here Crigman wants to finance her storefront. Storefront can mean a couple of different things; it can mean just the front of the stores, so you have a store on a street and you obviously have to have a front of the store, the part that people can see as they are walking or driving by. However we usually use this word storefront to refer to a small store that is on a street usually on the ground or bottom floor of a larger building. So there might be a building of three or four stories that is three or four levels and on the ground level, on the lowest level, the level that you can walk into from the street, you might have a series of stores, these would be storefronts, these would be stores that you can walk right into that are typically part of a larger building although not always. Sometimes we use this term storefront to refer to buildings that are just one level but that have small stores that you can easily walk into from the street. Crigman wants to finance her storefront, her store in this case a place to sell baked goods, things that you bake in an oven and in particular desserts. We call the place you sell bread and dessert a bakery. Crigman is already making desserts at home I guess, so she doesn’t need money for researching and developing her product the things she wants to sell. She does need money to actually open up bakery, open up her storefront. She says that she and her friend talked about bank loans and investors. A bank loan is money you get from a bank that you have to pay interest on; we talked about that possibility a few minutes ago. Investors are people who give you money for your business but they expect a certain percentage of the profit that you make from your business. Now if you don’t have any money then your investors lose their money. If you make millions of dollars, well your investors are going to get a percentage of that money; you have to agree with the investors what percentage that is going to be. Investors then are people who take the money and give it to a business because they think the business will be successful. The investor in a fact owns part of your business because you have to give part of your profits to the investor. Crigman and her friend spoke about bank loans and investors and then her friend told her about something called Kickstarter. Kickstarter is a website for a special kind of crowdsourcing called crowdfunding. To verb to fund means to give money to something. Crowdfunding would be asking people to give you money for your project. Let’s listen to Crigman one more time as she talks about this. “We were discussing the different options for financing my storefront and we talked about bank loan, investors and he told me Kickstarter.” Now we are going to hear Ya Ell talked about what she thinks about bank loan or going to an investors and why she doesn’t want to do that necessarily. Let’s listen. “Bank loans are difficult to get, especially for small businesses with not many assets and investors you know you have to get away a part of your company and I am very proud of what I built and I want to continue to grow up, I don’t just want to be a manager of a bakery.” Crigman begins by saying bank loans are difficult to get, especially for small businesses with not many assets. The key word in this sentence is the assets. An asset is something of value, something that usually can be sold for money or simply money. Money is one kind of asset. You might have other assets as well, you might own a building, the building which can of course be sold for money is also an asset, the furniture that you have in your office is an asset, and your computer equipment is an asset. All of these things could be considered assets, things are worth money. In the case of getting business loans you need to have asset that are worth something that the bank can take in case you don’t pay your loan back. So for example if I am going to buy a new car and I don’t own anything else, I don’t have a job and I don’t have a bank account, the bank would probably not loan me </span><span class="T2">any money because if I don’t pay my loan back, there is nothing they can go and take and sell, because I don’t have any assets. A small business especially one just starting out doesn’t have a lot of assets and so it is difficult to get a loan from a bank. Craigman also explains that investors are problematic as well. Problematic here means they cause problems; they have difficulties associated with them. The difficulty associated with investor she says that you have to give away part of your company. To give away is a two word phrasal verb meaning to give something to another person, so that you no longer have any control over it, you no longer own it. To give away your money would be to give your money to other people. To give away part of your company would be to give part of the ownership of your company to someone else. Sometimes give away is used when you don’t expect anything back from the other person. Here it is used a little bit differently. You are not actually giving away for free part of your company; you are exchanging ownership in your company or partial ownership in your company for the money investors giving you. So it is not quite correct to say that you are giving away part of your company if you think of giving away as meaning giving something to someone without getting anything back, giving a gift essentially. Crigman says that she doesn’t want to give ownership of her company to an investor, she says I am really proud of what I have built and I want to continue to grow it. We use the verb to build to refer to the act of putting something together or of constructing something other such as a house or a building. Building is a noun of course related to the verb build. However in this case, Crigman is using the verb to refer to putting together if you will her company. She is taking the different pieces of her company and putting them together so that it will make money. She also uses the expression to grow it. To grow something normally refers to a plant or a flower. You put, I seed on the ground and from that seed a plant grows. You can talk about people growing. You’ve grown a lot since I have seen you last, means you are now older and you look older. Usually we say that to children in fact we also have the phrasal verb to grow up which means get older especially as a child and adolescent. Here we are using the verb to mean to expand to make bigger or larger. To grow your business means to make your business larger, to expand your business. Crigman wants to continue to grow her business. She says at the end I don’t just want to be a manager at a bakery. A manager is a person who runs a business, but doesn’t necessarily own the business that is what Crigman does not want to do, she doesn’t want to work for someone else, and she wants to own her own business, her own bakery.      </span></p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
