As always we will answer if you have questions you have sent to us.  Let’s get start it. </span></p><p class="P5"><span class="T2">Our first topic in this café is one of the 20</span><span class="T16">th</span><span class="T2"> century most famous American athletes Jim Thorpe. Jim </span><span class="T9">Franciscus Thorpe, more commonly known as Jim Thorpe is widely acknowledged or said to be the greatest all-around-athlete that ever lived in the United States, being an all-around-athlete means that he could play many sports very well. He played baseball, American football, basketball, he ran track and he won two Olympic gold medals. Thorpe was born on May 1888 in the small town of Prague, Oklahoma. We have many cities in the US that are named after cities in Europe, is obviously named Prague after the city in modern Czech Republic are Prague is located about 60 miles that is 96,5 collimates east of </span><span class="T9">Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Oklahoma is in the very centre in the United States, north of the state of Texas. Thorpe had a twin brother named Charlie. Charlie is another form of the name Charles. A twin is a brother or sister who is born at the same time, on the same day as the other brother or sister. Two babies born at the same time are called twins, three are called triplets, four are called a lot of extra work for mom and dad. Jim Thorpe was born on a ranch which is similar to a farm but has animals like cows instead of crops or plants for food. Thorpe was a Native American sometimes called an American Indian and a member of Sauk and Fox tribe or group of Native Americans. His Native American name is Wa-Tho-Huk which means bright path in English. It was clear from an early age that Thorpe was a talented athlete by the time he was 10 years old, he could ride horses, shoot guns and swim very well. Compare this to me who at the age of 10 didn’t know how to ride a bike much less a horse. Thorpe and his twin brother Charlie were very close friends, sadly Charlie died of pneumonia, an infection of the lungs, in 1896 when he was only 8 years old. Jim Thorpe was extremely sad about the loss of his brother and soon last interest or was no longer interested in sports and in school. In 1989, his parent sent him to high school Indian school, a school in the state of Kansas which is close to Oklahoma. High school was a school only for Native Americans. Another sad moment of his live is mother died in 1901 of blood poisoning or an infection of the blood while giving birth to another baby, but their unhappiness didn’t stop there, his father also died of blood poisoning from an injury in 1904 shortly after Thorpe arrived at another school, The Carlisle Indian High School in 1903. Blood poisoning was common in the late 1800s and early 1900s because people didn’t understand the importance of cleaning wools, washing hands and keeping medical wools clean. Though Thorpe had always been interested in sports it was at Carlisle that his interest really grew. Carlisle was located in Pennsylvania which is in the eastern part of the United States, near the state of New York. In 1907 he joined the Intramural Football Team. Intramural Team is that any student of school joined and played and for fun. Thorpe was a very good football player; the school’s football coach noticed him and asked him to join the school’s regular team, the team that played against the teams from other schools. So Thorpe began playing football for the school in 1908. Thorpe also joined the track team and focused on jumping and hurdles. Members of the track team often run around all or part of a 400 meter track or circle as part of their competitions. Members of a track team also throw things and jump in the field, in the centre of the track. Thorpe focused on jumping and on hurdles. Hurdles are low structures with two flat sides and top that rest on the ground. To make a running races more difficult because the runner must jump over them while they are running around the track. Thorpe got bored of the school and left for two years during the years of 1909 and 1910. During this time he got a job playing baseball in North Carolina. In 1911 he went back to Carlisle and continued playing football and being on the tracking. He also began training for the 1912 Olympic Games. In addition to jumping and running, he learnt other track skills like throwing. At the 1912 Olympic trials where the athletes who will be members of Olympic team are selected, Thorpe was placed on the American Team. At the Olympics which took placed that year in Stockholm, Sweden, Thorpe won two gold medals, one for the pentathlon, one for the decathlon. The pentathlon is a track event where athletes compete in five different tasks; shooting guns, fancying, fighting using swords, swimming, horse riding and running. The decathlon is a track event where athletes compete in ten different running, jumping and throwing tasks. When the king of Sweden gave Thorpe’s gold </span><span class="T9">medals said “ You sir are the greatest athlete in the world”. Unfortunately for Thorpe in 1913 his medals were taken away from him, he had to give them back to the Olympic committee. Why? Well at that time it was an Olympic requirement that all athletes be amateurs. This meant that they could not be paid to compete or play in their sport, because Thorpe had been paid to play baseball briefly in the North Carolina in 1909 and 1910. He was accused and found guilty of not being an amateur athlete. This happened even though the gold medals he won were not in baseball. Thorpe’s medals were taken away and given to the athlete who placed second in those events. Although Thorpe was very upset by this, he didn’t let it stop him from playing sports, over the course of next 15 years. During the 15 years, he played professional baseball, football and basketball. He was also co-founder of all Native American football team called the Oorang Indians. He retired from or stopped participating in professional sports in 1928. Like many Americans, Thorpe struggled during the great depression in 1930s when many people lost their jobs and economy was in very bad shape. He had trouble finding work and took jobs in construction, building houses and buildings and as a security guard someone who guards or watches buildings. He moved out to California and became an actor in the movies but only got small roles and was never very successful. He made very little money and did not live the rich, fancy life; we now associated with professional American athletes. When Thorpe was diagnosed with lip cancer in 1951, he had a sick charity or help from others to pay for the treatment because he had no money to pay for it himself. He died of a heart attack on March 28 1953 living behind one wife, two ex-wifes and eight children. After his death, there were many people who were upset that Thorpe was not recognized as the incredible athlete that he was. For years these people ask the Olympic committee to give Thorpe’s gold medals back to him posthumously after his death. Finally in 1982 Thorpe’s gold medals were restored or returned to him and he was once again considered as one of the winners of the Olympic Games in Stockholm in 1912. Jim Thorpe is still considered to be one of the, if not the greatest athlete of all the time by many people and not just in the United States. What made Thorpe different from other athletes of his time and of today was not just his excellent athletic talent but his ability to play multiple sports extremely well. </span></p><p class="P4_borderStart"/><p class="P4_borderEnd"/><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
