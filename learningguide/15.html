We are going to be talking a little bit about smoking and driving in the United States. I am going to tell you a little bit about my meeting with the Queen. I actually did meet the Queen I will tell you about that and we will also answer some questions. So let’ get start it.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T2">I have to start with the most interesting thing that happened to me this weekend. My wife and I were at dinner, we were eating at a restaurant. We don’t normally eat in this restaurant, it is in Beverly Hills, but we have been there before Beverly Hills of course, very famous, very rich part of Los Angeles area, and we are not rich but we did eat at a restaurant there and I said I had a meeting with the Queen. Well, it is not the Queen of England however. It was a famous actress here in the United States and her name is Queen Latifah. Queen Latifah was started as a singer and still is I think a singer, but she is also an actress and was actually nominated for that is she was one of the five actresses that could have won the Oscar prize, the Oscar award, you probably know the Oscar, is the highest award for the actor or an actress or a movie in the United States. In England they have something called the Befta award for the best TV and movie series or movies or other, so (I was) we were in this restaurant Italian </span><span class="T2">restaurant called Il Forneo and we were walking out the door and there were 3 women that were walking into the restaurant and the third one held the door for me and my wife. To hold the door means to keep it open for you, so you can walk through, she held the door my fine and me and we thanked her and then we looked at her and we realized that it was this famous actress. She was talking on the cell phone, on her mobile phone. So we didn’t actually talk to her, so I kind of</span><span class="T1"> </span><span class="T2">met her, saw her really, and of course in Los Angeles there are lots of actors and actresses and so it is not that unusual to see someone when you go to grocery store or go to a restaurant and so forth. But it is always interesting, but Queen Latifah is a good actress and one who I think has a new movie coming out in the United States. We say coming out we mean that her movie will be released, you will be able to see it soon here in the Unites States. Moving on, two more important news there were a couple of interesting stories in the newspaper, in the magazines, news magazines this week. One was about smoking in the Unites States in many cities, in many states. There are entire smoking laws and here in California for example, it is illegal to smoke inside a restaurant, in fact it is illegal to smoke inside a bar, so you can’t go to a bar, have a drink and smoke. And that was allowed that was passed a couple of years ago. The idea is that when someone else is smoking if you are standing next to them and inhale, you breathe in; you could inhale that smoke that is sometimes called second hand smoke.</span></p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
