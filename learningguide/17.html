It was a survey of employees, someone who works for someone else. So that was a survey for workers in the United States and it asks them how much time they waste at work and to waste time means that you are not doing what you are supposed to be doing or you are relaxing. We also use the expression to kill time. To kill time means that I am trying to, I have extra time and I need to do something while I am waiting for something else to happen. Wasting time is not something most employers, people who hire you to work at a job that is not something they are looking for I don’t think. Well, the response was very interesting. It found that 37% of the time that people spend at work was wasted according to their own reports. One of the things is that people do of course is look at email and answer personal email, they look at different websites. There was another study that found that one out of every four that is 25% of American workers look at a blog every day. Some sort of website blog, and of course blog is one people post, put on the website their own personal comments and commentary. This however is not just a problem in the United States in the article I was reading said that in a survey of nine different country they found that about that same percentage about 1/3 of the time, people say they are not really working. Maybe they are listening to ESL podcast instead of working I don’t know. Had a question from a listener about the states in the United States and could I talk about what different states or parts of the United States are famous for. What people in the United States think about other states? Well, it is a good question. I thought I would start with California. Don’t worry. I won’t do all 50 states today, but I will start with California. Well, California is famous in the Unites States and in many parts of the world has been the home of Hollywood. Hollywood is where movies are made here in Los Angeles, but Hollywood is an actual neighborhood in Los Angeles, it is a part of the city of Los Angeles. There is a separate city called Hollywood. It is part of the larger city of Los Angeles. However when people talk about Hollywood really they are talking about the movie industry and television business, people who make movies and TVs even if they don’t work in that one neighborhood, so for example I live about 2 miles from Sony Studios which is not located in the neighborhood of Hollywood, but is very famous for being a Hollywood company. California is also famous for </span><span class="T3">its beaches; the most famous beach is probably Venice Beach in Los Angeles, Venice like the city in Italy. The beaches in Los Angeles are in southern California are also very famous.   </span></p><p class="P4"> </p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
