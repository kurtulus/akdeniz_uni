The movies in the United States are all well not all, but almost all rated by voluntary association called Motion Picture Association of America or The MPAA, and motion picture is the same as a movie, so this is the movie association and almost all of the big films, the big movies send their movie to this association before the movie is released, when we say released we mean before begins showing on the theatres, and The MPAA gives the movie a rating and the rating system is supposed to tell people who want to go see the movie what kind of movie and what age this movie is proper for. The rating system uses ladders and begins with G for general and G rated movie is a movie that anyone can go see. It is okay for children, it is okay for adults, no problem any age can go see this movie, so cartoons are often G rated, animated pictures finding Nemo those kinds of movies that are for children many of them. Those are G rated and that expression G rated will often see even for things that are not related to movies. Someone might say I had a G rated podcast, means my podcast can be listened to by anyone, there is no vulgar or dirty language and so forth. Well, G is the most general, the lowest rating if you will. The next rating is PG and PG stands for parental guidance. Parental of course comes from parent; guidance is the same as help. So what it is saying here is that parents should be careful about taking especially young children to this movie. The next rating is PG13. PG13 is a movie that anyone under 13 years old it may cause a problem, so if you are under 13, parents should think very carefully about whether they want to take their child there. There may be a sexual content in the movie, it may be very violent, there may be some vulgar or dirty language, those are sort of things that would give a movie PG13. The next rating is R and R is for restricted. This means that anyone under the age of 17 or 17 and under actually, anyone under the age of 18 so anyone 17 or under or less in terms of their age needs to have a parent or an adult go with them. And that is because R rated movies the most violent, possibly the movie that has the most mature scenes and ideas and language and so movie theatres are not supposed to let anyone into the movie that is 17 or </span><span class="T2">under unless their parent is with them. However in practice it is not that difficult for high school student 17 or under to go see an R rated movie, many movies theatres don’t obey that policy very well. The next rating which is very rare is NC17. NC17 means no one under the age of 17 can go to this movie.      </span></p><p class="P3"> </p><p class="Standard"> </p></body></html>
